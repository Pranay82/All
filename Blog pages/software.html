                            <p>
                                <br><br>
                                Today I'm going to talk about artificial intelligence or ai as they call it.
                                There's a lot of talk and definitions of ai.
                                <br><br>
                                One of them is <br>
                                Artificial intelligence or ai can be defined as a technology which makes machines act
                                more intelligently. Ai can also be defined as teaching the machines to learn, to act and
                                think as humans would.
                                Ai is the application of computing to solve problems in an intelligent way using
                                algorithms. Intelligent way may be seen as something that mimics human intelligence.
                                Ai is a very advanced technology; it helps us do things that we never could have done
                                before.
                                <br><br>
                                People usually have a very huge misconception about AI that "AI is here to take away
                                jobs and is going to replace human work" but I rather consider it as something which is
                                not here to replace humans but here to enhance human capabilities and accomplish tasks
                                that neither humans nor machines can do on their own. Artificial intelligence isn't
                                meant to replace us because on a fundamental level it's a completely different thing
                                than a human brain.
                                <br><br>
                                According to a study by PWC, 16 trillion dollars of GDP will be added between now and
                                2030 on the basis of AI.
                                This is a never before seen scale of economic impact and it is not just in the IT
                                industry, it impacts virtually every industry and aspect of our lives.
                                <br><br>
                                AI means different things to different people- for a video game designer, ai means
                                writing the code that affects how bots play and how the environment reacts to the
                                player. For a data scientist ai is a way of exploring and classifying data to meet
                                specific goals.
                                <br><br>
                                AI Learns by providing the machines the ability to examine examples and create machine
                                learning models based on the inputs and desired outputs.
                                <br><br>
                                Ai algorithms that learn by example are the reason we can talk to Siri, Cortana, Alexa
                                and Google assistant and they can talk back to us.
                                <br><br>
                                Artificial Intelligence is something which impacts our everyday life. If you have ever
                                used the Google search engine they give you optimized, so near to what you asked for
                                results based on AI.
                                <br><br>
                                Over the years AI has proven to be useful in different domains, impacting the lives of
                                our people and our society in meaningful ways.
                                There's Al in our Netflix queue, our navigation apps, keeping spam out of our inboxes
                                and reminding us of important events.
                                <br><br>
                                Al is working behind the scenes monitoring our investments, detecting fraudulent
                                transactions, identifying credit card fraud, and preventing financial crimes.
                                Al is impacting healthcare in significant ways, by helping doctors arrive at more
                                accurate preliminary diagnoses, reading medical imaging, finding appropriate clinical
                                trials for patients. It is not just influencing patient outcomes But, also making
                                operational processes less expensive.
                                <br><br>
                                Al has the potential to access enormous amounts of information, imitate humans, even
                                specific humans, make life-changing recommendations about health and finances, correlate
                                data that may invade privacy, and much more.
                                <br><br>
                                Some AI experts predict that AI will be able to do anything that humans can but do it
                                better. This is a questionable assumption, but AI will surely surpass humans in specific
                                domains. A chess computer beating the world chess campion was the first example.
                                <br><br>
                                So, let's look forward to a future in which Al plays a central
                                role in freeing us from the dull, the mundane, the dirty, the dangerous jobs and
                                hopefully providing us with more time to spend with our families. Better health,
                                potentially, better healthcare. Thank You!

                            <p>
                                Now before we get to know about What an Intrusion Detection System is. We will first get
                                to know what an intrusion means. Intrusion means attempting to break into or to misuse
                                your system that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a
                                computer source. Intruders could be from outside the network or the users of the network
                                themselves. An intrusion could be physical, system or remote.<br><br>
                                Different ways to intrude are<br><br>
                                1) Buffer Overflow Attacks. <br>
                                2) Common Gateway Interface Scripts. <br>
                                3) Race conditions <br>
                                4) Trojans. <br>
                                5) Worms and many more<br><br>

                                Now let us know what an intrusion detection system is<br><br>
                                An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a
                                network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation
                                is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event
                                management system. Some IDS’s are capable of responding to detected intrusion upon
                                discovery. These are classified as intrusion prevention systems (IPS).<br><br>
                                <b>IDS Architecture</b><br><br>
                                Since the first model for intrusion detection was developed by Dorothy Denning [56] at
                                SRI International, many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed both in
                                the research and commercial world.<br><br>
                                Although these systems are extremely diverse in the techniques they employ to gather and
                                analyze data, most of them rely on a relatively general architectural framework (Figure
                                2-4), which consists of the following components:<br><br>
                                * Data gathering device (sensor) is responsible for collecting data from the monitored
                                system. <br><br>
                                * Detector (Intrusion Detection (ID) analysis engine) processes the data collected from
                                sensors to identify intrusive activities.<br> <br>
                                * Knowledge base (database) contains information collected by the sensors, but in
                                preprocessed format (e.g. knowledge base of attacks and their signatures, filtered data,
                                data profiles, etc.). This information is usually provided by network and security
                                experts. <br><br>
                                * Configuration device provides information about the current state of the intrusion
                                detection system (IDS). <br><br>
                                * Response component initiates actions when an intrusion is detected. These responses
                                can
                                either be automated (active) or involve human interaction (inactive).<br><br>

                                Another free but high-quality tool is the Suricata IDS/IPS. It works as a NIDS and uses
                                a complete signature language to determine known threats, and what kind of behaviour is

                                traffic, and the engine is built around a modern and scalable code base designed to
                                perform at a high level. It automatically detects protocols on any port and can apply
                                detection logic to each packet and protocol as it comes through. As part of this, it can
                                log HTTP requests, which can help detect scanning or flooding attacks using large
                                numbers of “normal” protocol requests to overwhelm a network. <br><br>
                                It can detect malformed code or requests using protocol keywords, rule profiling, file
                                matching, pattern matching with machine learning, and extensive tuning options.<br><br>
                                <b>Suricata Architecture</b><br><br>
                                Each packet is ﬁrst processed in decoding functions and then in detection modules.
                                Decoding functions read the packet and save the decoded data into an internal
                                representation of the packet. The decoding functions are called one at a time on the
                                packet. Extending the decoding functionality is possible by implementing a new decoding
                                function and placing it into the decoding pipeline. The decoding pipeline starts with
                                the source of captured packets, then L2 is decoded, and then protocols on higher layers
                                are decoded. Upon decoding, the packets pass detection. The detection is governed by
                                rules and depends on the decoding step. The rules are matched with the internal packet
                                representation. The matching process is broken into several detection<br><br>

                                Upon decoding, the packets pass detection. The detection is governed by rules and
                                depends on the decoding step. The rules are matched with the internal packet
                                representation. The matching process is broken into several detection modules in all of
                                which the matching takes place. Unlike decoding, detection is parallelized and one
                                packet can be processed in multiple detection modules at the same time. Extending the
                                detection functionality is possible by implementing a new detection module and
                                registering it in the table of detection methods.<br><br>
                                <b>Advantages of Suricata</b><br><br>
                                * Does the network traffic processing on the seventh layer of the OSI model which, in
                                turn, enhances its capability to detect malware activities.<br><br>
                                * Automatically detects and parses protocols like IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, TLS, FTP, SMB
                                and FTP so that rules apply on all protocols.<br><br>
                                * Advanced features consist of multi-threading and GPU acceleration.<br><br>
                                <b>Limitations of Suricata</b><br><br>
                                * Less support as compared to other IDSs like Snort.<br><br>
                                * Complicated in operation and requires more system resources for full-fledged
                                functioning.<br><br>
