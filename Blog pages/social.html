                            <a href="#" class="con">Corruption</a>
                            <p>
                                By corruption, we mean that any dishonest or immoral behavior or activities that result
                                in the gain of some powerful organization or people. Thus, corruption often results in
                                loss to the weaker section of the society or organization. There are different forms of
                                corruption. It includes extortion, nepotism, parochialism, bribery, patronage, cronyism,
                                etc. Corruption may lead to human and drug trafficking, money laundering, police
                                brutality, repression of opponents, etc. <br><br>
                                Forms of Corruption<br><br>
                                A Bribe involves a payment made to any official for the exchange of use of his official
                                powers. It involves two parties: the one who pays for any favor and the one who accepts
                                the payment for official powers.<br><br>
                                Influence peddling or trading in influence involves three parties to act. It means a
                                person or organization selling their influence over the decision-making process so that
                                a third party profits from it.<br><br>
                                Favoring supporters (Patronage), favoring relatives (Nepotism) and favoring friends
                                (Cronyism) of an official for private gain are forms of corruption. In these many
                                incompetent people are leaders in the system over the able ones.<br><br>
                                Illegal interference with the election process is Electoral fraud. The theft of
                                entrusted public funds for personal benefit is Embezzlement.<br><br>
                                <b>Effects of Corruption</b><br><br>
                                Political effect: Corruption becomes a major roadblock for the rule of law and
                                democracy. The political system loose its legitimacy when power is used for private
                                advantage.<br><br>

                                Economical effect: It depletes national wealth. The betterment of the communities and
                                societies are compromised for the benefit of the profit of some officials, therefore,
                                leads to the misuse of national resources.<br><br>

                                Social effect: The community or society gives up trust in the system. This makes it even
                                more challenging to remove corruption from the system.
                                <br><br>
                                Environmental effect: Corruption results in the degradation and exploitation of precious
                                natural resources. This results in turbulence in the ecological systems.<br><br>

                                <b>Ways to fight Corruption</b><br><br>
                                There are five ways of fighting corruption.<br><br>
                                Effective law enforcement is the key to ensure the corrupt culprit is punished. For this
                                purpose, we need a strong legal framework.<br><br>
                                Steps focussing on improving financial management and strengthening the role of auditing
                                agencies will help in curbing corruption. This will include transparent and
                                participatory budgeting by local communities and local governments.<br><br>

                                The tradition of government openness, freedom of the press, transparency, and access to
                                information help in curbing corruption.<br><br>
                                Strengthening citizens’ demand and empowering them to make government accountable is a
                                great approach to build mutual trust between the government and the citizens.<br><br>
                                The international financial system should be under the scanner to stop money laundering
                                by corrupt officials. Hence, major financial institutes need to put a check to stop
                                their banks and allied financial centers across the globe from accepting illegal flows
                                of money.<br><br>
                                <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
                                To sum it up, Corruption is the biggest evil of any society. All necessary steps must be
                                taken to eliminate this evil. Not only the ones with power but at times even the weaker
                                section of the society tend to become a culprit in this.<br><br>
                                I hope that from now on every individual will strictly oppose and prevent corrupt
                                activities from occurring anywhere around us. Thus, this will ensure the complete
                                socio-economic and political development of our society and country at large.<br><br>

                            <p>
                                Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects
                                how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to
                                others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from
                                childhood and adolescence through adulthood. <br><br>
                                Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking,
                                mood, and behaviour could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health
                                problems, including:<br><br>
                                Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry, Life experiences, such as trauma
                                or abuse and Family history of mental health problems<br><br>
                                Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of
                                children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family,
                                live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church
                                pew.<br><br>
                                However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma
                                attached to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher medical
                                expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities and
                                increased risk of suicide.<br><br>
                                <b>What You Can Do to Help</b><br><br>
                                Mental Health Awareness 2016Although the general perception of mental illness has
                                improved over the past decades, studies show that stigma against mental illness is still
                                powerful, largely due to media stereotypes and lack of education, and that people tend
                                to attach negative stigmas to mental health conditions at a far higher rate than to
                                other diseases and disabilities, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease.<br><br>
                                Stigma affects not only the number seeking treatment, but also the number of resources
                                available for proper treatment. Stigma and misinformation can feel like overwhelming
                                obstacles for someone who is struggling with a mental health condition. Here a few
                                powerful things you can do to help:<br><br>
                                Showing individuals respect and acceptance removes a significant barrier to successfully
                                coping with their illness. Having people see you as an individual and not as your
                                illness can make the biggest difference for someone who is struggling with their mental
                                health.<br><br>
                                Advocating within our circles of influence helps ensure these individuals have the same
                                rights and opportunities as other members of your church, school and community.<br><br>
                                Learning more about mental health allows us to provide helpful support to those affected
                                in our families and communities.<br><br>
